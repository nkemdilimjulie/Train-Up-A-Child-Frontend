- **Language & Framework Language:** JavaScript Framework: React (as used inside Next.js)
- **Styling**: CSS (can extend with Tailwind or Sass)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL Database
- **Hosting**: Vercel or any cloud platform
- **Backend Integration**: Consumes a PostgreSQL database served by a robust ``Django`` backend

---
‚úÖ Language & Framework
Language: JavaScript 
Framework: React (as used inside Next.js)
Meta-framework: Next.js with the App Router (which uses React under the hood)

‚úÖ Styling
Base: CSS Modules (default in Next.js)

Optional Extensions:

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first, fast prototyping

Sass/SCSS: More structured and nested styling
>SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. SCSS stands for Sassy CSS. Type. SASS is a popular CSS preprocessor. It is a newer SASS syntax

‚úÖ Database
Planned: PostgreSQL Database

Access via Mongoose (schema-based ODM)

Or Prisma (powerful TypeScript ORM that now supports MongoDB)

‚úÖ Hosting
Primary Choice: Vercel (best for Next.js)

Alternative: Any cloud/VPS that supports Node.js (e.g., Render, Railway, Heroku, etc.)

This project is working in a JavaScript/React ecosystem, specifically using Next.js (App Router) which gives you hybrid rendering (SSR + SSG + ISR) and tight integration with frontend/backend logic.

**-- Proverbs 22 verse 6
# Train Up a Child Charity Organization

##  A Short Description of the Project

As the name already indicates, this is a charity organisation that seeks <br>
for donors who shall support the education of the less-priviledged children. 

A Call for Help:

>Children in Africa needs an SOS to their educational System<br>


Everyone is asked to:

Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.   ***Proverbs 22 verse 6***

# app Descriptions

+ ```success app``` 
Includes a Back to Home button.
1. when a sponsor makes a donation and the process is successful, this success page is displayed.
at the browser:
````
http://localhost:3000/success
````

2. and Displays a message with optional donation amount of 50 dollar from query parameters (?amount=50).
at the browser:
````
http://localhost:3000/success?amount=50
````

+ ```cancel app``` 
Includes a Back to Home button. (goto ``/``)
1. when a sponsor makes a donation and the process is **NOT** successful, this cancel page is displayed.
at the browser:
````
http://localhost:3000/success
````

2. and Displays a message with optional donation amount of 50 dollar from query parameters (?amount=50).
at the browser:
````
http://localhost:3000/success?amount=50
````

+ ```test-stripe app``` 

The TestStripe page is just a temporary helper page for development. It does not replace your real /success or /cancel pages. Think of it as a ‚Äúbutton playground‚Äù to quickly test navigation.

# Next Step

Frontend and backend stripe payment testing - continue to debug the errors

+ add backend APIs to connect and use the PostgreSQL DB data
