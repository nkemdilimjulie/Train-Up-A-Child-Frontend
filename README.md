# Train-Up-A-Child 🎓

> A Next.js-based platform to connect sponsors with needy kids for educational support and general upkeep in remote areas.


---

## 🌟 Project Description

**Train-Up-A-Child** is a compassionate sponsorship platform that allows users to:
- Register as a sponsor
- Sponsor a specific child’s education
- Donate to support children's overall wellbeing

Built with **Next.js**, the project focuses on accessibility, simplicity, and meaningful connections between sponsors and children in need.

## 🚀 Features

- 🏠 **Home** – Project introduction and mission statement
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **About Us** – Vision, team, and goals
- 💰 **Sponsors** – Register as a sponsor or view other sponsors
- 👶 **Needy Kids** – View profiles of children needing help
- 📞 **Contact** – Reach out for inquiries or feedback
- 🔗 **Navbar Component** – Seamless navigation across pages

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: CSS (can extend with Tailwind or Sass)
- **Database (Planned)**: MongoDB (via Mongoose or Prisma)
- **Hosting**: Vercel or any cloud platform

---
✅ Language & Framework
Language: JavaScript (or TypeScript, if preferred)

Framework: React (as used inside Next.js)

Meta-framework: Next.js with the App Router (which uses React under the hood)

✅ Styling
Base: CSS Modules (default in Next.js)

Optional Extensions:

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first, fast prototyping

Sass/SCSS: More structured and nested styling

✅ Database
Planned: MongoDB

Access via Mongoose (schema-based ODM)

Or Prisma (powerful TypeScript ORM that now supports MongoDB)

✅ Hosting
Primary Choice: Vercel (best for Next.js)

Alternative: Any cloud/VPS that supports Node.js (e.g., Render, Railway, Heroku, etc.)

This project is working in a JavaScript/React ecosystem, specifically using Next.js (App Router) which gives you hybrid rendering (SSR + SSG + ISR) and tight integration with frontend/backend logic.
